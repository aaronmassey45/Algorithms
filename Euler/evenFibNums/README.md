Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...`

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed `n`th term, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

`fiboEvenSum(10)` should return `188`.  
`fiboEvenSum(23)` should return `60696`.  
`fiboEvenSum(43)` should return `1485607536`.  
Your function should return an even value.
