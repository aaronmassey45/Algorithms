Given a string, replace each its character by the next one in the English alphabet (`z` would be replaced by `a`).

**Example**

For `inputString = "crazy"`, the output should be
`alphabeticShift(inputString) = "dsbaz"`.

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**

- **[input] string inputString**

  Non-empty string consisting of lowercase English characters.

  _Guaranteed constraints:_  
  `1 ≤ inputString.length ≤ 1000`.

- **[output] string**

  The result string after replacing all of its characters.
