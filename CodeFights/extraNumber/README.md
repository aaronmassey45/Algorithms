You're given three integers, `a`, `b` and `c`. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. What is the value of the third integer?

Example

For `a = 2`, `b = 7`, and `c = 2`, the output should be
`extraNumber(a, b, c) = 7`.

The two equal numbers are `a` and `c`. The third number (`b`) equals `7`, which is the answer.
