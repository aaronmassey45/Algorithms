---

The DNA strand is missing the pairing element. Take each character, get its pair, and return the results as a 2d array.

Base pairs are a pair of AT and CG. Match the missing element to the provided character.

Return the provided character as the first element in each array.

For example, for the input `GCG`, return `[["G", "C"], ["C","G"],["G", "C"]]`

The character and its pair are paired up in an array, and all the arrays are grouped into one encapsulating array.
